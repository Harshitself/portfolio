WElcome to README page of my portfolio website

Design :-  I myself designed the whole website.

code :- All the code written for making this website is written by my.Yes,but i do have taken help from internet whenever i got stucked.

        I have used pure HTML,CSS and ,JAVASCRIPT for making this so that i can improve core knowledge of these topics.

code-structure :- All the code is written according to the layout flow of the website and also i have used the appropriate comments inside the code.

Learning :- In journy of building this site i come to face very intresting problems.
                
                I have mentioned some of them below :-
                     
                     1.> css position and display-flex property not work together.

                     2.> using clip-path property on parent element of navbar can effect its property.

                     there are many i will keep adding them here 

Improvements :-  I think i can improve features and code readability(like in css i can set the properties according to the ascending order of alphabet they start from.) .

I will keep updating this website from my learnings.

Thank you .
